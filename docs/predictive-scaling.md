# Predictive Scaling

Reactive autoscaling only adds capacity after load has already spiked, so
users feel the lag while new capacity comes online. `predictive_scaling::PredictiveScaler`
keeps a rolling history of traffic samples, forecasts near-term demand, and
recommends a replica count ahead of time.

Implementation: `backend/src/predictive_scaling.rs`.

## Traffic history

A background task (`predictive_scaling::run`, spawned from `main.rs`)
samples the delta of `ethos_protocol_http_requests_total` every
`sample_interval` (5 minutes in production) and records it as a
`TrafficSample` in `PredictiveScaler::history` (default: 288 samples, i.e.
24h of 5-minute buckets).

## Forecasting model

`ForecastModel` implements **Holt's double exponential smoothing**: it
tracks a smoothed *level* and *trend* across the sample history so the
forecast accounts for traffic that is actively rising or falling, not just
its most recent value. `alpha`/`beta` control how quickly the level/trend
adapt to new samples.

## Predictive scaling algorithm

On each evaluation:

1. Forecast demand `SCALING_FORECAST_PERIODS_AHEAD` sampling intervals into
   the future.
2. Convert the forecast to a replica count: `ceil(forecast / SCALING_REQUESTS_PER_REPLICA)`.
3. Clamp to `[SCALING_MIN_REPLICAS, SCALING_MAX_REPLICAS]`.
4. If the recommendation changed, apply it via `AutoscalerClient`.

## Backtesting

Before trusting a `ForecastModel` (or a new `alpha`/`beta` tuning) to drive
live scaling decisions, replay it against historical traffic with
`ForecastModel::backtest(samples, periods_ahead)` (or `PredictiveScaler::backtest()`
to backtest against a scaler's own recorded history).

Methodology: walking forward through `samples` (oldest first), at every
point with at least two samples of history the model forecasts
`periods_ahead` sampling intervals out, using only the samples available up
to that point — the actual sample that arrives `periods_ahead` intervals
later is then compared against that prediction. This is repeated for every
such point, so the result reflects the model's accuracy across the whole
history rather than a single lucky/unlucky forecast.

It returns a `BacktestResult`:

- `sample_count` — number of (prediction, actual) pairs evaluated.
- `mean_absolute_error` — average absolute difference between predicted and
  actual request volume.
- `mean_absolute_percentage_error` — average relative error (over periods
  with nonzero actual traffic).
- `root_mean_squared_error` — like MAE but penalizes large individual misses
  more heavily.

A model whose backtest error is too high for a given traffic pattern should
not be trusted to drive real scaling decisions — tune `alpha`/`beta`, or
gate `predictive_scaling::run` behind a periodic backtest check, before
relying on it in production.

## Autoscaling integration

`AutoscalerClient` is a small trait (`set_desired_replicas(replicas: u32)`)
so `PredictiveScaler` stays decoupled from any specific platform. The
default `LoggingAutoscalerClient` just logs the recommendation — swap it for
a real Kubernetes HPA / ECS service-scaling client to actually drive
infrastructure.
